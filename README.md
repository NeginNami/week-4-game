# week-4-game

This project is a game called crystal game. In this game you have 4 crystals and a random number genereated by computer. Each crystal adds a certain number to your total score. Which is generated randomly by computer. Your goal would be raising your total score till it matches the "score" (random number). If you go above the score you would lose the game. Basically the good aproach is to see what number each crystal generates at first, then try to raise your total score to that point using the crystals which generates a proper number. That means not clicking on crystals which might increase your score more that the total score.

###Getting Started 

Please go to this URL: https://neginnami.github.io/week-4-game
Try to reach the score which is shown on top.

##Prerequisites & Installing

Just a web browser would be enough to run the game. I would recommend Google Chrome. You don't need to install anything extra.

###Deployment

This game is deployed on github. So by this link: https://neginnami.github.io/week-4-game you can access to it. 

###Running and test

I put some cosole log in the code. So it make it easier to test the game. If you open your console in your Chrome you can see which number each crystal generates after clicking on it.
This would be helpful when you want to get to a certain state (win or loss) in order of testing the game.
